# CHAOSS Data Science WG Datasets

This is where we can store datasets for [projects](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-data-science/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aproject) being worked on within the Data Science Working Group.

If you would like to contribute a dataset, please create a new subfolder containing your data, and please follow our [Contribution guidelines](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-data-science/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) including DCO sign-off for all commits.

So far, we have one dataset right now for analysis of projects making [license changes](license-changes) to their open source projects.
