## Introduction

### Goal

Build a community of data scientists to collaborate on the CHAOSS Data Science Initiative.

### Purpose

We will collaborate with data scientists and researchers to shape how we understand open source community health and make it easier for people to use CHAOSS tools, metrics, and metrics models to draw meaningful insights that they can use to improve open source project health using data science-based approaches.

### Who should join this working group?

Anyone interested in data science and data analysis can join. You don't need to be an expert or know how to perform advanced techniques, like machine learning or artificial intelligence. We welcome data scientists, data analysts, researchers and others with an interest in data.

### Background

This is a new working group within the CHAOSS project to support our Data Science Initiative.
