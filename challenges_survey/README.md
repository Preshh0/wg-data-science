# Understanding Challenges Survey

In August and September, the CHAOSS project ran a survey of existing and past users of CHAOSS tools and metrics designed to help us better understand the barriers and challenges that make it difficult for people to gain meaningful, empirically-driven community health insights using CHAOSS tools and metrics. The [blog post](https://chaoss.community/survey-help-the-chaoss-project-improve-our-tools-and-metrics) has more details about the survey.

In the spirit of open source, we are making the raw data available to the CHAOSS data science community to encourage people to work together to interpret the data. The raw data with personally identifiable data redacted can be found in the raw_data directory in this repo. The CSV file contains everything except the free form responses. Because there were very few reponses from certain groups (e.g., universities, government, nonprofit), attaching the free form responses to rest of the data made it possible to identify the person / group responsible for certain comments, so the order of the free form comments in the text documents has had the order randomized and some text redacted to prevent identification. Here are the filenames with the raw data:
* Clean_CHAOSS_Understanding_Challenges_Survey.csv - responses to the quantitative parts of the survey
* other_challenges_freeform_redacted.txt - free form text responses to the question, "What other challenges have you faced that werenâ€™t in the above list or what else would you like to see us improve?"
* strengths_freeform_redacted.txt - free form text responses to the question, "What do you see as CHAOSS project strengths (what do you love about CHAOSS)?"
* understanding_challenges_graphs.pdf - simple graphs produced by Google forms displaying the responses for each question

We've created a draft_interpretations directory where community members can upload your interpretations of the data using a Pull Request to create files in that directory.

We will also create an "official" or final report that will be shared with the rest of the CHAOSS community along with recommendations for improvements. If you are looking for those results, you'll be able to find them here in this repository in October or November.
