	The CHAOSS Data Science Community is interested in collaboratively working together on projects. The goal is to build a community of active data scientists within the CHAOSS project who are using CHAOSS data to help answer questions. To get the most value out of a CHAOSS Data Science Initiative, we need to scale our data science efforts and share best practices for using data science-based approaches to understanding project health. This requires building a diverse and inclusive community of people with different ideas, perspectives, and skills who can help define and promote our data science efforts. This will allow us to provide value as a project by using CHAOSS data and data science approaches to answer questions from the other WGs and elsewhere within the CHAOSS community while also allowing people to get more real world data science experience.
